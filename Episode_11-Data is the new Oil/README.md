# Higher Order Component
-->Concretely, a higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.
-->const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);

# Control Component
-->In React, Controlled components refer to the components where the state and behaviors are controlled by Parent components

# Uncontrolled components
-->Uncontrolled components are the ones having control of their own state and manage the behaviors on themselves

# Context API
-->To avoid props drilling

-->In React, the Context API is a feature that provides a way to share values like themes, user authentication status, or other settings, across the entire component tree without having to pass props manually at every level.

-->It helps in solving the problem of prop drilling, where you need to pass data through multiple levels of components.
